Subject: Request Regarding Workspace Change

Dear [Manager's Name],

I’ve been working from my current setup for the past six months without any issues, so I was a bit surprised by the sudden change in seating.

I’d prefer to continue here and will ensure my tasks are completed on time. If needed, I can switch to the new place the next day.

Thanks for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
