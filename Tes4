Title: Setup GemFire Configuration, S3 Integration, and WebClient for Admin Service Communication

Story:
Configure Apache Geode (GemFire) for caching, including region definitions and data serialization.
Integrate Amazon S3 for file storage operations.
Implement WebClient configuration to enable communication with external Admin Service APIs.
This setup ensures efficient caching, external file handling, and seamless service integration.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. GemFire cache is properly configured with required regions.


2. Region types (e.g., partitioned or replicated) are aligned with business requirements.


3. S3 client is configured using secure credential management.


4. Utility methods for file operations (upload/download) to/from S3 are implemented and tested.


5. WebClient is configured with appropriate timeouts, headers, and base URL for Admin Service.


6. API interactions with Admin Service are functional with proper error handling and logging.


7. Configuration properties are externalized for environment-specific values.


8. Unit/integration tests cover all core logic and configurations.



Story Points: 8
