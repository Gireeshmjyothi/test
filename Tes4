Title: Implement Bank Config Retrieval with GemFire Cache Fallback and Admin Service Integration

Story:
Implement logic to retrieve bank configuration data from GemFire cache.
If the data is not available in the cache, fallback to calling the Admin Service API to fetch the data.
Cache the fetched data from the Admin Service into GemFire for future requests.
Include unit and integration tests to verify all scenarios.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Bank configuration is first fetched from GemFire cache.


2. If data is not present in the cache, Admin Service is called via WebClient.


3. The response from Admin Service is cached in GemFire for future use.


4. Proper error handling is in place for cache miss and API failure.


5. Logs are added for traceability when fallback is triggered.


6. Unit tests are added to validate:

Cache hit scenario

Cache miss and fallback to Admin Service

Cache population after fallback



7. Integration tests are added to verify end-to-end behavior.



Story Points: 5 (can be 8 if multiple config types or complex mapping is involved)
