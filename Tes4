Here’s a generic Jira story for setting up a scheduler and Liquibase configuration, written in a reusable and team-friendly format:

Title: Configure Application Scheduler and Liquibase for Database Version Control

Story:
Set up a scheduled task mechanism within the application to run time-based jobs.
Integrate Liquibase for managing database schema changes through version-controlled changelogs.
This setup ensures automated background processing and reliable, trackable DB updates.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Scheduler is configured using Spring's @Scheduled or equivalent mechanism.


2. Scheduled tasks run at defined intervals or cron expressions.


3. Task logic is modular, configurable, and idempotent.


4. Liquibase is integrated into the project for database versioning.


5. SQL or YAML changelogs are created and executed correctly on application startup.


6. Liquibase maintains a changelog table to track applied changes.


7. Environment-specific configurations (e.g., disabling Liquibase in prod) are externalized.


8. Logging is added for both scheduler execution and Liquibase changes.



Story Points: 5 (can be increased to 8 if there are multiple scheduled jobs or complex changelog structure)

Let me know if you’d like this split into subtasks or if the scheduler has any specific business logic.
