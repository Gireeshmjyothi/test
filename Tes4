Title: Implement Retrieval of Bank File Configuration by SFTP Path and File Type

Story:

Enable retrieval of bank file configuration based on the provided sftpPath and fileType.
This will support accurate identification and processing of bank files based on their location and format.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. The system should retrieve the bank file configuration matching the given sftpPath and fileType.


2. If no matching configuration is found, a clear and meaningful response or error should be returned.


3. The implementation should handle edge cases such as invalid inputs or multiple matching records (if applicable).


4. Unit tests should be added to cover all relevant scenarios.
