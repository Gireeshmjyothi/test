Story Title: AWS S3 Integration for File Upload and Download

Story Description:
Implement functionality to upload and download files to/from AWS S3. The solution should use the AWS SDK, support configurable bucket names and paths, and ensure secure, efficient file handling.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Upload files to the configured S3 bucket with dynamic file names/paths.


2. Download files from S3 using the object key.


3. Externalize AWS credentials and bucket configuration.


4. Include error handling and logging for both operations.


5. Ensure support for different file types (e.g., CSV, Excel, PDF).

Let me know if you'd like to add multipart uploads or pre-signed URL support in the scope.
