Title:

Publish RFS ID, MID, and Status to Summary File and Mark Payout as Successful


---

Description:

As part of the payout process, we need to update the payout summary file with the following details for each processed record:

RFS ID

MID

Payout Status


Once the records are published successfully into the summary file, update the payout status as SUCCESS for those entries.


---

Acceptance Criteria:

[ ] Fetch records with pending payout status.

[ ] For each record, publish the RFS ID, MID, and current status to the summary file.

[ ] After publishing, mark the payout status as SUCCESS in the database.

[ ] Ensure proper logging and error handling in case of any failures.

[ ] Summary file should follow the predefined format (CSV/Excel etc., if applicable).



---

Notes:

The payout summary file will be used for reconciliation or audit purposes.

Make sure idempotency is maintained to prevent duplicate status updates in case of retries.

If a record fails during publishing, it should not be marked as SUCCESS.

Let me know if you want to include details like where the file is stored (e.g., SFTP path) or if this is part of a larger batch job.
