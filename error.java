Story Title: SFTP Client: Download and Move File Implementation

Story Description:
Implement an SFTP client utility to connect to a remote SFTP server, download files from a specified source directory, and move them to a target (archive) directory post-download. The solution should support secure authentication, configurable connection settings, and robust error handling with logging.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Connect to the SFTP server using credentials and connection details from application.properties.


2. Download files from the configured source directory.


3. Move successfully downloaded files to the target/archive directory.


4. Ensure proper logging for each operation (connect, download, move, errors).


5. Handle exceptions and implement retry logic for transient failures.
