Certainly! Here's a generic and readable Jira story description that anyone (developers, QA, product owners) can understand:


---

üìå Story Title:

Set up Apache Spark local environment for application development


---

üìù Story Description:

Set up and integrate Apache Spark in local mode (local[*]) on a Windows development environment.
This setup will allow the team to run and test Spark-based data processing logic directly within the Spring Boot application, without requiring a full Spark cluster.

The integration should support Java 21 and be compatible with the project's existing Gradle build system.


---

‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria:

Spark is configured to run in local mode using local[*].

Required dependencies are added and verified via Gradle.

A simple Spark job runs successfully within the Spring Boot project.

The setup works on Windows with Java 21.

Logging is properly configured for Spark output.

Setup steps and usage instructions are documented for the team.

Let me know if you want this reformatted for a sub-task, or if you need a README snippet as part of the documentation deliverable.
