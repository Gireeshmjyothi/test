User Story:

Title: Update recon_file_summary Table by rfsId with Reconciliation Results

Description:
As part of the reconciliation process, the system should update the recon_file_summary table using the provided rfsId. This includes updating the counts of:

Matched records

Unmatched records

Duplicate records

Reconciliation status (reconStatus)


This ensures that reconciliation results are accurately stored and accessible for reporting and auditing.


---

Acceptance Criteria:

[ ] A valid rfsId is passed to perform the update.

[ ] The following fields in recon_file_summary are updated:

matched_record_count

unmatched_record_count

duplicate_record_count

recon_status


[ ] The update is based on business logic for reconciliation.

[ ] Invalid or missing rfsId is handled gracefully with error logging.

[ ] The system logs the update operation.

[ ] The update logic is covered by automated test cases.

Test Cases:

✅ Positive Test Cases:

1. Valid rfsId with reconciliation data

Input: Valid rfsId, mock data for matched, unmatched, and duplicate records

Expected: All fields in the table are updated correctly with the expected counts and reconStatus = COMPLETED



2. Valid rfsId with 0 matched and only unmatched records

Expected: matched_record_count = 0, unmatched_record_count > 0, status = COMPLETED



3. Valid rfsId with duplicate entries

Expected: duplicate_record_count > 0, status still set correctly




❌ Negative Test Cases:

4. Invalid rfsId (non-existent)

Input: rfsId that does not exist in the database

Expected: No update is made, and an error is logged



5. Null or missing rfsId

Input: rfsId = null

Expected: Exception thrown or handled, with error response/log



6. Reconciliation fails mid-process

Simulate exception or incomplete data

Expected: reconStatus = FAILED or rollback applied
