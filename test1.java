Subject: Discrepancy in Leave Deduction for April – Request for Review

Dear [HR’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well.

I am writing to bring to your attention a discrepancy in my April 2025 leave records. According to my records, I had taken 7 days of leave in April, including applicable sandwich leaves. However, I noticed that 9 days of leave have been deducted.

Additionally, on 7th April, I had a logout miss on the Connecto mobile app, for which I had received manager approval. Despite that, it seems to have been counted towards my leave.

I have attached a screenshot of my Connecto login history for your reference. I kindly request you to review and help rectify the leave count.

Please let me know if you require any further details from my side.

Thank you for your support.
